# The-Survey-Form
This is the FreeCode Camp Survey form challenge.

### Things I learned in the process: 

- For using ```margin : 0 auto;``` the ```width``` should be set to certain number or percentage where it is not equivalent to 100%.
- While using ```form``` elements like ```lable``` and ```input``` where once the ```input class is set to 100%``` the ```lable``` class should have ```flex``` property for any additional margin or padding.
- Inside ```form input``` element if you want to leave a gap for place holders then ```padding``` should be applied there which removes it from touching the margin.
- The width of ```textarea``` can also be controlled from the flex items.
- The Name property for ```radio & checkbox``` should be applied if you want them to work as a group where one selected next one is not.
- The JS CDN of freeCode Camp is added for testing.
